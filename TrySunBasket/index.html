				"Thank you so much for inviting me into your kitchen. Feeding people is my passion, and I love sharing the freshest seasonal ingredients and globally inspired recipes with you. I believe food should be real, healthy, and always delicious. We work with the best farmers, ranchers, and fishermen, who care deeply about the environment. We’ve listened to what matters to you, which is why our produce is organic, our meats are antibiotic- and hormone-free, and our seafood is wild-caught.
